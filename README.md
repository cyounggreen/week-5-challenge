# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description
 The goal of this project was to create a working daily scheduler of events using Bootstrap, Moment.js, and jquery. When functional, their should be time slots that change color based on whether they are past, present, or future. Due to time constraints, this project does not currently have that function working, but the skeleton for getting that to work is included in the Javascript code.
  Currently, the only working code is the very top Moment.js code. This will be revised at a later date in order to make all of the functions work properly.
 

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md (/assets/screenshot.jpeg) ```
